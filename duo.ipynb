    "Although first exposed to circuit board soldering in an 'Intro to Electronics' class during my freshman year of high school, I'd hardly touched an iron over the years that had passed since then, and it's thus safe to say that I embarked upon my journey toward successfully recapping a [PC Engine Duo](https://necretro.org/PC_Engine_Duo) as a complete novice.\n",
    "\n",
    "My efforts toward this end would have been doomed were it not for the troves of wisdom made freely available by folks like [Voultar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiUAFHtzv_2xJHEjWIk1fOw) and [Simon Lock](https://aergan.wordpress.com/). In the write-up that follows below, I summarize the tips, tricks, and best practices that helped me get my old Duo working again. I'll also discuss the mistakes I made along the way, in hopes that doing so will enable others to avoid similar pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Most Valuable References\n",
    "1. Voultar's [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe0DvzKMNe4) covering the complete recapping process from start to finish. It's no exaggeration to say that this is *the seminal* soldering how-to video of our time.\n",
    "2. Simon Lock's [Twitter threads](https://aergan.wordpress.com/?s=pc+engine) that chronicle his experiences recapping different Duos and other PC Engines.\n",

    "\n",
    "Voultar's video is geared towards relatively inexperienced solderers and is hands down the canonical walkthrough of the Duo recapping process. Simon Lock and 8bitplus' summaries confront the edge cases often encountered when working on Duo boards that have seen significant corrosion stemming from the original capacitors' electrolytic fluid leakage. Finally, the Console5 wiki is the place to turn when identifying and replacing circuit board components that have been corroded beyond repair."

    "## II. Removing the Old Surface Mount Capacitors\n",
    "Voultar recommends, and I concur, that removing all the old capacitors in one fell swoop is far more efficient than removing and replacing each capacitor, one by one. As to the question of how to remove the surface mount caps, there are a variety of approaches, but on this one point the experts [are unanimous](https://youtu.be/oe0DvzKMNe4?t=429): **don't ever use wirecutters**, as doing so will likely damage the solder pads underneath the caps.\n",
    "\n",
    "My preferred technique for removing surface mount caps is to use a hot air rework station; this method is also recommended by Voultar. A decent rework station costs less than &#0036;30.\n",
    "1. Voultar [says](https://youtu.be/oe0DvzKMNe4?t=580) to set the rework station's temperature to 320℃ and airflow to 50\\%. \n",
    "2. Hold the nozzle two inches above the cap to be removed and continuously rotate the nozzle in a circular motion. After 5-10 seconds of this, gently try to remove the cap using tweezers. If the solder underneath the cap is molten, it can be pulled off the board with no resistance.\n",
    "3. **Always cover nearby plastic components and IC chips with Kapton tape!** This prevents the hot air emitted from the nozzle from causing any unintended melting or other damage.\n",
    "4. **Wear safety goggles!** The hot air may cause old, damaged caps to explode and launch themselves right off the circuit board. Your skin can withstand this, but don't take any chances with your eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the danger of clogging vias, hot air rework will likely vaporize some of the leaked electrolytic fluid that hasn't been cleaned from the main board. These vapors carry a strange fish-like odor, and they are toxic when inhaled. Using a fume extractor will help mitigate this, but my hunch is that the best prevention is to pre-clean the board using an ultrasonic cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Console5's wiki offers a [summary](https://console5.com/wiki/Converting_from_Surface_to_Leaded_Capacitors#Removing_the_old_capacitor) of other techniques for removing SMD capacitors. Note that 8bitplus prefers to individually heat the solder on each pad with an iron, slowly and gently lifting up on the corresponding side of the cap while doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Second Mistake: Melting the Volume Potentiometer\n",
    "Despite making (what I thought was) a careful attempt to thoroughly shield the thumbwheel volume potentiometer with Kapton tape, I melted half of the wheel when removing the nearby caps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Melted Duo Stock Pot](duo_images/duo_vol_pot_m_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "    \n",
    "What may have precipitated this:\n",
    "1. I did not apply Kapton tape to the *underside* of the potentiometer wheel, and instead only covered the top of the wheel and surrounding board with tape.\n",
    "2. I had already been working for two hours straight without a single break, and was unaware that my concentration had begun to wane.\n",
    "3. The volume potentiometer is simply just too close to the nearby SMD caps, and the probability of heating the solder underneath this caps without overheating the potentiometer's thin, plastic wheel is unacceptably high no matter the precautions taken. \n",

    "## IV. Cleaning the Circuit Board Post-Cap Removal\n",
    "I believe that this is *the* most crucial step of the entire capacitor replacement process. Failing to remove any electrolytic fluid or corrosion still sitting on the circuit board at this point will doom your console to certain failure at some point in the future. Lightly scrubbing affected areas with IPA and a fiberglass pen or toothbrush is usually sufficient. Voultar demonstrates how [here](https://youtu.be/oe0DvzKMNe4?t=1410).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Pads with Extensive Corrosion\n",
    "However, some SMD capacitor pads may be exceedingly corroded and light scrubbing with a fiberglass pen might not be enough to sufficiently restore conductivity:\n",
    "![SMD Pad with Stubborn Corrosion](duo_images/stubborn_corrosion_h_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these \"worst of the worst\" pads, I slowly and steadily repeated the following process as many times as necessary until the pad was free of corrosion:\n",
    "1. Add some fresh solder to the pad.\n",
    "2. Wick away the solder.\n",
    "3. Gently scrub with a fiberglass pen and IPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took me anywhere from 30-60 minutes to fully clear *each pad* that had stubborn corrosion. My mantra throughout was \"slow and gentle,\" as I didn't want to inadvertently lift these pads or breach nearby traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, I used solder to tin over any exposed copper:\n",
    "![SMD Pad Cleaned and Tinned](duo_images/cleaned_and_tinned_l_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unclogging Vias\n",
    "Astute readers will notice that two vias in the \"before\" version of the previous pic were completely clogged up with corrosion and vented electrolytic fluid:\n",
    "![Some Clogged Vias](duo_images/clogged_vias1_l_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem becase:\n",
    "1. These vias have *zero* conductivity!\n",
    "2. Unless fully removed, the dried electrolytic fluid inside the vias will continue to eat away at the board and corrode the connected copper traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for me, there were several areas on my Duo's PCB with vias that were stopped up full of this corrosive gunk. I circled some of the worst offenders in the image below:\n",
    "![More Clogged Vias](duo_images/clogged_vias2_l_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Happily, I found that simply flushing many of these clogged up vias with a syringe full of IPA was enough to restore perfect conductivity.\n",
    "![Syringe with IPA](duo_images/syringe_m_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "My technique was as follows:\n",
    "1. Choose a syringe tip with the same gauge as the via you want to clean.\n",
    "2. Slowly insert the tip into the via and gently begin to expel some IPA from the syringe.\n",
    "3. Once it becomes possible to do so, insert the syringe fully into the via so that it pokes fully through the circuit board.\n",
    "4. Press on the syringe to start expelling some more IPA. While you're doing this, slowly raise the syringe back out from inside of the via. As this happens, the IPA will come into contact with the inside of the via at a fairly high pressure and will do a good job of getting the passageway fully clear.\n",
    "5. Slowly and gently repeat until you're satisfied that the via is clear of corrossive debris.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Flushing a Via](duo_images/flushing_a_via_l_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",

    "## V. Repairing Broken Traces and Missing Vias\n",
    "Unfortunately, there were several spots on my Duo PCB where simply flushing gunked-up electrolytic fluid out of the vias was not enough to restore continuity. There were more than a few areas where corrosion had completely rotted out the via and accompanying trace:\n",
    "![Broken Trace](duo_images/broken_trace.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "After using a fiberglass pen to remove any persistent corrosion, I knitted these traces and vias back together using 30-gauge Kynar (wire wrapping) wire:\n",
    "![Knitted Via and Trace](duo_images/knitted_vias1_l_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "My technique was to:\n",
    "1. Use a fiberglass pen to remove enough solder resist that's covering the still-uncorroded part of the trace, so as to expose a solderable copper surface.\n",
    "2. The thinner the trace, the longer the length of the portion of the trace that must be exposed. Soldering a longer span of Kynar wire on top of a thin trace allows for a stronger, more durable solder bond.\n",
    "3. Strip and cut a small length of 30-gauge Kynar wire (the [wire strippers recommended on Voultar's Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/shop/voultar?listId=2TC0UEEJ06B8X) can accomplish this).\n",
    "4. Slip the stripped wire through the via until there is just enough Kynar wire remaining to cover the exposed portion of the copper trace. Then bend the wire at 90° so that it's flush with the PCB surface, and solder the wire to the exposed trace lengthwise (so that the length of the wire fully covers the length of the exposed trace).\n",
    "5. Turn the circuit board over and repeat steps 1. and 2. for the trace on the opposite side of the board that's connected to the via through which the you'd inserted the wire. \n",
    "6. Finally, cut still-unsoldered opposite end of the Kynar wire so it's long enough to cover the exposed portion of the trace just exposed in step 5., and ensuring that the wire is flush with the board surface, solder lengthwise to the trace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that 30-gauge Kynar wire is ideal because, after being stripped, it can fit through the smallest vias found on the Duo's PCB. I bought mine [here](https://www.elliottelectronicsupply.com/page-30-gauge-kynar-wire-wrap-white-50-foot-spool.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your Duo PCB is anything like mine, there could be numerous traces/vias that would need to be repaired. Visual inspection, coupled with painstaking continuity testing (using a DMM) of all traces and vias in areas damaged by corrosion helped me identify the best candidates for repair. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knitting vias back together is indeed a delicate, time-consuming process, but it's more than worth the peace of mind that comes with not having to worry that your Duo's mainboard might have a conduit that could fail at any time.\n",

    "\n",
    "The SMD cap soldering technique that ultimately worked best for me was:\n",
    "1. Add fresh solder to each of the two pads.\n",
    "2. Use a solder braid to wick all solder off each pad (removes any old solder that may have been contaminated by corrosion).\n",
    "3. Place the new cap on top of the pads and verify polarity.\n",
    "4. Add solder to the iron tip and, while using tweezers to keep the cap in place, lightly tack one of the cap's leads to its pad.\n",
    "5. Repeat for the cap's other lead.\n",
    "6. Add some more solder to each pad to ensure that the bonds are durable and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer doing things this way because it makes it easier for me to affix the SMD caps so that they *flatly* sit on top of (flush with) the circuit board. I found that, at least in the case of the Duo's SMD caps, if I first locate the cap so that its center lies right in the middle of the two pads on the board, there is generally enough room to tack the tip of each of the cap's leads to its designated pad.\n",

    "If you have other broken parts on your Duo circuit board, such as the [CD lid sensor switch](https://console5.com/store/turbo-duo-pc-engine-duo-cd-lid-pin-switch.html), chances are that Console5 [has you covered](https://console5.com/store/catalogsearch/result/index/?p=1&q=turbo+duo).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Commodity Chips\n",
    "But if you need to replace any [non-proprietary chips](https://console5.com/wiki/Turbo_Duo#Chips_.26_ICs) on your board that don't happen to be in-stock at Console5, you may have luck with [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/), [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/), or even eBay if you feel you can adequately vet the seller.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I had to replace my Duo's [M51131L volume balance chip](https://console5.com/wiki/M51131L) because its leads were  corroded beyond repair, and I was able locate a suitable replacement [on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/M51131L-New-MITSUBISHI-IC-ZIP-14-2-CHANNEL-ELECTRONIC-VOLUME-BALANCE-STOCK-USA/362981433808). \n",

Seeing as how the stock 7805 regulators on any Duo are now upwards of 30 years old, I agree that replacing them is probably wise.\n",

    "The modern replacements for these chips cost 75 cents, each, and can also be found [at Console5](https://console5.com/store/7805-l78s05cv-high-output-2a-5v-voltage-regulator-3-pin-to-220-5v.html). Be sure not to forget to apply a fresh dab of thermal paste when you replace these. [Like Lock](https://twitter.com/A3rgan/status/1175883105674190848/photo/1), I also prefer Arctic Silver's [Ceramique formulation](http://www.arcticsilver.com/ceramique.htm), as it doesn't contain any electrically conductive ingredients in its mixture.

    "## A Deeper Wisdom: The Best Way to Prevent Mistakes\n",
    "1. In all work you perform on the circuit board use finesse, not force.\n",
    "2. Devote your full attention, concentration, and focus to each individual muscle movement of each task. \n",
    "3. Mistakes can and will cascade, so take frequent breaks (especially if you just made a mistake)! Resist the urge to complete your Duo's restoration as quickly as possible. (The system is 30+ years old; things can always wait another day.)\n",
    "4. If (when) you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up. Take a deep breath, forgive yourself, and come up with a new plan of attack. With enough time, effort, and persistence, all mistakes (short of something catastrophic like melting a hole clear through the board's proprietary graphics chip) are fixable.\n",
    "\n",
    "My biggest blunders occurred when I had worked too long without taking time away from my workbench to rest and refresh. I didn't understand that as a novice, I lacked both the mental and muscle memory to be able to work for an extended duration without also seeing an exponential increase of the probability of my screwing something up (like melting the volume potentiometer wheel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more significantly, I found that mistakes often *cascaded* after I'd been working too long in one sitting; in a frenzied attempt to address the consequences of my first mishap, I inadvertently made a second mistake, and then so on and so forth. The best thing I could have done would have been to walk away once the first snafu occured, and then come back the following day with fresh pairs of eyes and hands, not to mention a revised and cohesive strategy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Sixth and Final Mistake: Not Taking Breaks\n",
    "Sadly, I learned all of the above lessons the hard way. When I first began this restoration project, I couldn't resist the temptation to want to rush to the finish line. I'd often extend a single working session for several hours, long after my concentration had waned.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I didn't understand at that time was that as far as projects like this go, consecutive days of *quality work* performed slowly and methodically compound much greater over the long term than one or two marathons of frenzied \"effort.\" \n",

    "![RGB Wiring on Duo PCB Underside](duo_images/rgb_underside_wiring_l_sz_m_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. RGB and Csync\n",

    "### 3. Regarding Wire Tautness and Sturdy Solder Joins\n",

    "Voultar consistently maintains, and I concur, that with decent materials (leaded solder, flux) and proper technique, solder joins can be sturdy enough to withstand moderately vigourous jostling without the aid of hot glue.

I recommend doing this, and below I provide a summary of the modifications that Voultar [recommends](https://youtu.be/rhRww_SmKmc?t=229) be performed in order to configure this connector for compatibility with the Duo's mainboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A.  Re-use the Two Anchor Ground Pins from the Duo's Original DIN-5 Connector\n",

    "#### B. Cut the Blue, Green, Red, and Csync Pins Short but Not Too Short\n",
    "The DIN-8 connector's blue, green, red, and csync pins will be wired directly to the DuoRGB board. As such, these four pins must be shortened so that there is no chance they could ever come into contact with the Duo's circuit board.\n",

    "However, if cut too short, there's a significant risk that these pins will come into contact and short each other out. This is because there won't be anything holding them firmly in place inside the DIN-8's housing. Voultar's [solution](https://youtu.be/rhRww_SmKmc?t=440) is to cut these four pins short enough such that their tips lie above the surface of the main board, while at the same time ensuring that afterwards the pins will still be long enough to reside inside DIN-8 connector's lower plastic housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I ensured that I could successfully accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "The length from the top of the blue/red pins to the bottom of the lower part of the DIN-8's plastic housing is 10.2mm:\n",
    "![Top of Blue/Red Pins to Bottom of Plastic Housing](duo_images/din8_pin_top_housing_bottom_m_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "And the length from the top of the blue/red pins to the top of the lower plastic housing is 8.3mm:\n",
    "![Top of Blue/Red Pins to Top of Plastic Housing](duo_images/din8_pin_top_housing_top_m_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we cut the blue and red pins (located on the left/right sides of the connector's rear row of pins) to a length of 9.25mm, we can ensure that their tips will lie halfway in between the top and bottom of the lower part of the DIN-8 connector's plastic housing:\n",
    "![Ideal Cut Length](duo_images/din8_ideal_cut_length_m_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you then cut the green (center-rear) and csync (right-front, if you're looking at the DIN-8 connector from behind) such that their tips are level with those of the freshly cut blue and red pins, you'll be able to ensure that all four pins are stable and snug, yet still well out of danger of ever touching the mainboard:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### C. Removing Part of the Plastic Backing\n",
    "The DIN-8 connector that Voultar ships comes with a plastic backside that will need to be partially removed in order to make it easier to solder the blue, green, and red wires to their respective pins.\n",
    "He explains what to do in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQpQMA-R130).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I altered the plastic back:\n",
    "![Plastic Backing Partially Cut Away](duo_images/din8_backside_cutaway_m_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cutting the notch out of the center made it easier for me to solder the green wire to its pin:\n",
    "![Plastic Backing Green Pin Exposed](duo_images/din8_backside_notch_m_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Soldering the Blue, Green, Red, and Csync Wires\n",
    "Here is how I soldered the blue, green, red, and csync wires to their respective pins:\n",
    "![DIN-8 Pinout](duo_images/din8_pinout_l_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, here is an up-close view that better depicts the location of the csync pin at the front of the right side:\n",
    "![Up-Close View of the DIN8 Connector and its Csync Pin](duo_images/din8_up_close_with_csync_pin_l_sz_h_qual.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how I soldered the green wire along the length of the back edge of its pin (at the center-rear). This was why I cut that extra notch out of the DIN-8 connector's plastic backing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't Give Up!\n",
    "If your journey is anything like mine was, you'll experience what may feel like a never-ending stream of setbacks as you forge ahead in your sojourn to recap, repair, and RGB-mod your PC Engine Duo. There were several junctures where I felt like I was one step away from giving up and washing my hands of the whole endeavor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, I pushed forward and can now whole-heartedly say that I'm glad I did. It's difficult to express how satisfying it feels to have been able to bring this console back from the dead, make it better than ever, and transform it into a fully operational, RGB-enabled PC Engine Duo:\n",
