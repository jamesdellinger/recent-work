Image filename convention:

<original file name>_<image size>_sz<image quality>_qual

Image size = what jpeg size I chose when exporting from Apple photos:
-either "m" or "l" 
-if missing, photo is original full size

Image quality = what jpeg quality I chose when exporting from Apple photos:
-is usually "m"
-if missing, photo is maximum jpeg quality
