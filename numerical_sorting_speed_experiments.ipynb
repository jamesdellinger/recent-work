    "# Numerical Sorting for Decision Trees\n",

    "\n",
    "Numerical split finding is where decision tree growing algorithms spend the bulk of their time, and so optimizing this aspect of the codebase will yield the biggest bang for the buck if one wishes to speed up their decision tree implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, sorting numerical feature values in ascending order is the first step toward finding a numerical split, and so in this cohort of experiments I've tested out various pure Python implementations of the [Introsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort) sorting algorithm that's used in both [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) and [Ranger](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger/blob/5f71872d7b552fd2cf652daab92416f52976df86/src/Data.cpp#L227) (when using \"SmallQ\" splitting instead of pre-sorting numerical features).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning by doing\n",
    "As someone who is in the midst of creating his own decision trees library from scratch, my aim in all this was to get intimately acquainted with the introsort algorithm and all its components, and to understand why each of these sub-routines is indispensable. In addition to reading the pertinent academic papers, I found that walking through other popular libraries' (Numpy, libstdc++, etc.) introsort implementations and then reproducing them on my own in Python did the most to deepen my intuition and solidify my understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surveying then faithfully recreating in Python the different approaches that \"the pros\" have taken in implementing introsort to run performantly gave me the exposure and context to then be able to pick and choose, \"a la carte,\" the algorithms, styles, conventions, and tricks that most closely matched my way of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The final product\n",
    "I ultimately distilled my code down to a single pure Python implementation of introsort, which I then translated to Cython. When I went to benchmark the speed of my implementation against Sklearn's Cython version of introsort, I was surprised to find that over the past few years, Sklearn has used no fewer than [two](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/95d4f0841d57e8b5f6b2a570312e9d832e69debc/sklearn/tree/_splitter.pyx#L515) [different](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/ddc8210c7716cb287f167e502fb716e894cec6fc/sklearn/utils/_sorting.pyx#L19) sorting algorithms in its decision trees module, and that neither of them have been *completely consistent* with what [David Musser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Musser) specified in his [1997 paper](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/gp/introsort.ps) that introduced the Introsort algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn's most recent sorting logic, which was initially touted as a new and improved refactor, contained an achilles heel that would shortly force the team to have to revert to the older implementation. Later in this notebook I walk through what happened there, and why their new sorting implementation broke, and how the moral of that story is that Musser's introsort is as necessary as ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, other major implementations haven't made similar missteps. Ranger for example, being written in C++, uses `std::sort`, which is faithful to what Musser recommended. Numpy's `np.sort` is also nearly identical to Musser's introsort, with the exception of one [minor difference](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/5ffb84c3057a187b01acdeaa628137193df12098/numpy/core/src/npysort/quicksort.cpp#L197), on which I'll further elaborate in the section just below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introsort\n",
    "Before I discuss in greater detail what's been going on over at Sklearn, here's an summary of Musser's conception of and justification for introsort, per his 1997 paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use an efficient implementation of Median-of-Three Quicksort ([Bentley & McIlroy, 1993](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.8162&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) to begin recursively sorting a list of numbers. \"Efficient\" here means:\n",
    "     1. Swap equal elements. \n",
    "     2. A decent quicksort implementation will recurse on only the smaller branch of a partition and allow the larger sub-partition to be handled in the next go-round of the current while-loop. This ensures that stack depth will be no larger than $O(\\log N)$. Otherwise, it would be $O(N)$. However, this is not necessary for introsort because introsort already enforces a simple max recursion limit that on its own prevents recursion from exceeding a stack depth of $O(\\log N)$.\n",
    "     \n",
    "        For example, Numpy manages to break this requirement for quicksort implementations by [placing the larger side of a partition on the stack](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/5ffb84c3057a187b01acdeaa628137193df12098/numpy/core/src/npysort/quicksort.cpp#L197) and then iterating over the samples that remain inside the smaller partition. But crucially, this won't hurt Numpy's performance since the fact that it employs a full-fledged introsort implementations means that either way, stack depth will not exceed $O(\\log N)$.\n",
    "     3. Set a minimum length threshold for sorting subproblems, where sequences shorter than this threshold are not recursed (or iterated) over using quicksort, but are left alone until all longer sequences have been addressed. \n",
    "     4. These short sequences are then mopped up in one final pass over all numbers using [insertion sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/). Stanford Computer Science Department Senior Lecturer [Keith Schwarz](https://keithschwarz.com/) [explains](https://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/introsort/Introsort.hh.html) that this is because insertion sort runs faster than quicksort on average ($O(N)$ vs. $O(N\\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of items to sort) when all elements are no further than a given maximum distance from what will be their final sorted locations. In the libstdc++ implementation of `std::sort` this threshold is [set to](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/d9375e490072d1aae73a93949aa158fcd2a27018/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/stl_algo.h#L1864) $16$. In Numpy's implementation, $15$ [is used](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/5ffb84c3057a187b01acdeaa628137193df12098/numpy/core/src/npysort/quicksort.cpp). \n",
    "2. Keep track of recursion depth and cease any further calls to quicksort once a maximum depth of $2*\\log_2 N$ has been exceeded. Switch over to heapsort to finish all remaining samples in the branch. $2*\\log_2 N$ was chosen as the depth threshold based on Musser's empirical results.\n",
    "3. The motivation behind heapsort's inclusion: while quicksort has an average computing time of $O(N\\log N)$, in its worst-case scenario it goes quadratic with a time of $O(N^2)$. Although heapsort is on average two to five times slower than quicksort, its worst-case computing time is only $O(N\\log N)$. Switching from quicksort over to heapsort once recursion gets too deep gives us all the speed benefits of median-of-three quicksort, while protecting us in those situations when quicksort would lag well behind heapsort.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside: Where to do insertion sort\n",
    "Similar to optimized implementations of median-of-three quicksort, Musser's introsort runs one final pass of insertion sort over the entire list of numbers after all recursive calls have been completed. However, some practitioners might wonder whether it would be better to initiate several calls to insertion sort throughout the sorting process, making one call on each branch where partition size had decreased below the minimum length threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Musser also investigated this in his paper. He knew that running one final pass of insertion sort could double the number of memory [cache misses](https://hazelcast.com/glossary/cache-miss/), but that older computers didn't have that much memory to begin with and it was virtually certain that the cumulative cache miss penalties incurred by running insertion sort only once wouldn't be greater than the overhead of running insertion sort at the end of each and every recursion branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, he hypothesized that for of modern machines with more memory to sort longer sequences, the cumulative cache miss penalty of running insertion once might actually be more significant than the overhead of running it several times inside introsort's recursive loop. In other words, Musser believed there was a chance that moving insertion sort inside his sorting function's recursive loop would speed up sorting performance on computers with large memory capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, Musser's experiments demonstrated that even on modern machines, calling insertion sort just once near the end of sorting was *almost always faster* than calling it many times throughout sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But how much do we really need heapsort?\n",
    "When Bentley and McIlroy published their median-of-three partitioning strategy in 1993, they fixed one of the greatest flaws of the classic quicksort algorithm -- namely, that its compute time would go quadratic when attempting to sort a sequence of numbers that was nearly already perfectly sorted. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in his 1997 paper Musser identified a general category of numerical sequences that he called \"Median-of-3 Killer Sequences.\" Ideally, median-of-three partitioning should split a sequence of numbers into two sub-sequences of roughly identical length. Median-of-three killer sequences, on the other hand, will force median-of-three quicksort to split a sequence of $N$ numbers into sub-sequences of $2$ and $N-2$ numbers. This triggers an excess of partitions created during sorting, which in turn leads to deeper recursion and ultimately causes the sorting algorithm to go quadratic and require $O(N^2)$ time to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Musser acknowledged that in everyday practice, these killer sequences were not nearly as commonplace as the \"nearly sorted\" lists of numbers that cause classic quicksort implementations to go quadratic. However, he still believed that it was unreasonable to presume median-of-three killer sequences would be equally as rare as any other type of sequence found under a uniform distribution of numerical sequence permutations. Indeed, Musser was persuaded by [the 1992 work](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.29.2135&rep=rep1&type=pdf) of Ming Li and Paul Vitanyi and thought that the simple fact that median-of-three killer sequences can be produced by a short computer program warranted the assumption that these sequences occur under a universal distribution, as opposed to a uniform distribution, and would thus be more common than otherwise expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Example of a \"Median-of-3 Killer\" Sequence\n",
    "Here's the recipe for generating a median-of-three killer:\n",
    "1. Take a consecutive sequence of $1, ..., 2k$ integers where $2k$ is divisible by $4$.\n",
    "2. Permute the sequence such that the new order is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $1,\\;k+1,\\;3,\\;k+3,\\;5,\\;...,\\;2k-3,\\;k-1,\\;2k-1,\\;2,\\;4,\\;6,\\;...,\\;2k-2,\\;2k$\n",

    "## The Importance of Heapsort\n",
    "We just observed what happens when quicksort blasts past its average computing time of $O(N\\log N)$ and goes parabolic and hits its worst-case scenario where it requires $O(N^2)$ time to sort numbers. A greater than hundred-fold slowdown is no laughing matter, and the possibility of quicksort grinding to a crawl like this is precisely what spurred Musser to invent introsort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introsort was so named because Musser designed the algorithm to be *introspective* about how efficiently quicksort's median-of-three partitioning scheme was working. Ideally, a median-of-three partition should split a sequence of numbers into two roughly similar-sized sub-partitions. And when this is the case, quicksort's recursion will not grow terribly deep relative to the number of items to be sorted. However, should the median-of-three rule begin making several grossly unbalanced splits by sending just a few items to one sub-partition while funnelling all the rest to the other (the kind of behavior triggered by a median-of-three killer sequence), then recursion depth will snowball and cause compute time to go quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "What introsort does is keep track of recursion depth, and when recursion does get too deep (because too many inefficient partitions have been made), introsort stops quicksort in its tracks and forces it to pass the baton off to the heapsort algorithm to finish things up. At this point, instead of the current sub-partition getting further sub-divided by median-of-three, heapsort will sort all the numbers inside this sub-partition in one fell swoop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although heapsort tends to be a bit slower than quicksort at its best, heapsort's worst-case compute time is only $O(N\\log N)$. Therefore, switching over to heapsort whenever recursion gets too deep is a surefire way to prevent quicksort from going quadratic on us. "

    "\n",
    "I'll shortly demonstrate how to implement heapsort in Python and use it in introsort as Musser intended. But first, in order to further underscore my opinion that it may not have been such a good idea for Sklearn to remove heapsort from the numerical sorting algorithm that they use to grow decision trees, I'll run the median-of-three killer experiment once more, but this time using none other than Sklearn's newly-refactored sorting algorithm.\n",

During the sorting process, row indices get swapped with each other as their corresponding values get swapped. In other words, the feature values are sorted in-place as their row indices get argsorted in-place. \n",

    "This, ladies and gentlemen, is the difference between $O(N\\log N)$ and $O(N^2)$ compute time -- Sklearn's deprecated sorting logic was *only twice as slow* when sorting a median-of-three killer sequence. This is nowhere near as bad as the refactored code's two-hundred fold slowdown!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So why did Sklearn get rid of heapsort?\n",
    "Indeed, why would the Sklearn team insert an achilles' heel into their sorting routine? I can only assume they are either not aware of median-of-three killers or perhaps, unlike Musser, they believe the likelihood of a group of numbers drawn from a dataset column would causing quicksort to go quadratic is so infinitessimally small that it's not worth planning for.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the new sorting function was merged, the reviewers touted a [15% speedup](https://twitter.com/thomasjpfan/status/1506043093107318788) thanks to the new code. However, this was based on a [benchmark test](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22868) that created a synthetic dataset using [the normal distribution, randomness, and other heuristics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html). Needless to say, none of the columns made quicksort go quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside: But where did the refactored version's \"15%\" speed-up come from?\n",
    "Notice that when sorting non-killer sequences of random numbers, that Sklearn's new sorting logic completes the task in 34.7ms, while the older implementation required 39.1 ms. In this case, the newer code was 11% faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look carefully over Sklearn's old sorting code, you'll notice that contrary to Musser's design, Sklearn had omitted insertion sort from its implementation of introsort. And while the new, refactored code still doesn't use a full-fledged implementation insertion sort, it does specify how to handle partitions with just two or three numbers. In their 1993 paper that introduced median-of-three quicksort, Bentley & McIlroy acknowledged that quicksort has severe overhead when run on small partitions, and this was why they recommended using insertion sort on such small sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe it's reasonable that the lack of any strategy to handle small partitions may have hampered Sklearn's prior sorting implemention. And thus, it's my hypothesis is that the introduction of the logic to handle super small partitions of 3 numbers or less may well be responsible for the improved performance (on non-killer sequences) that convinced the Sklearn reviewers that the refactored sorting algorithm was the way to go."

    "#### Aside: Passing Numpy Arrays to Cython Functions\n",
    "By far the trickiest part of converting my pure Python introsort implementation to Cython was figuring out how to properly pass a Numpy array to my new Cython functions. In the end, I followed the approach recommended by [Laura Mendoza](https://members.loria.fr/LMendoza/), which is to define and pass a C pointer to a Numpy array. Laura ran a set of [speed tests](https://members.loria.fr/LMendoza/link/Cython_speedup_notes.html#Working-with-numpy-arrays-in-I/O) comparing the various ways of handing Numpy arrays off to Cython and found that C pointers were fastest.\n",

    "## In Conclusion: Introsort is the Best\n",
    "The speed of my home-grown Cython version of introsort is nearly identical to Numpy's `np.sort()`. This shouldn't be surprising, seeing as how both my and Numpy's introsort implementations use heapsort to pretect against deep recursion and use insertion sort to handle small partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the biggest bombshell finding of this notebook was that Sklearn's [newly refactored](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22868) sorting code blows up and goes quadratic when facing a median-of-three killer sequence. This is because it relies recursive calls to quicksort regardless of how frequently the median-of-three algorithm creates lopsided partitions for a given sequence of numbers. Too many lopsided partitions leads necessitates deeper recursion, which makes compute time go quadratic in the worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn's older sorting implementation fares much better on killer sequences, as it used heapsort to prevent catastrophic slowdowns. However, even when sorting randomly drawn sequences of numbers, both Sklearn sort routines are nearly twice as slow as my Cython code. I hypothesize that this is partly due to the fact that my code doesn't use quicksort for partitions containing less than 16 numbers, while Sklearn's newer algorithm uses quicksort for all partitions containing four or more numbers. What's more, Sklearn's older sort function uses quicksort for *all* partition sizes, no matter how small. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Aside:  How much does using insertion sort really help?\n",
    "I believe that at least part of the reason my sort function is faster than either of Sklearn's is because it doesn't use quicksort on partitions holding less than 16 numbers, instead leaving them all to be mopped up by a final pass of insertion sort. However, it's also reasonable to assume that part of Sklearn's slowdown stems from the fact that it had to perform twice the number of swaps, given that it's designed to concurrently argsort a list of indices as it sorts the list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, on a final lark, I modified my Cython introsort implementation to dual sort row indices along with raw numerical values just like Sklearn does in order to test it out and see if it still runs faster than Sklearn's sort functions."
